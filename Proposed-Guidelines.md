# Vendor Information

1. **Neutral Treatment of Vendors**  
Vendors must not be promoted or demoted in any documentation, communication, or system configuration.
2. **Component References**  
Specific vendor components should not be explicitly named. When necessary, use generic phrasing such as “a component like XYZ” or entertain enabling a component specification that does not favor a particular vendor.

# Use of Non-OCP Document Information
**General Principle**  
All specifications must include only materials for which the organization holds the necessary usage rights or that are legally available for free and unrestricted use.

**Best Practices**
* Prefer Referencing Over Incorporation 
Whenever possible, reference external material rather than embedding it directly in the specification. 
* Avoid Version Lock-In 
Referencing helps prevent binding the specification to a specific version unless absolutely required. 

**When Inclusion Is Necessary** 
* Use Original Wording 
Describe the information in your own words whenever possible. 
* If Direct Inclusion Is Required 
Clearly state the source of the material. 
Ensure all legal and usage requirements are met (e.g., copyright notices, required attribution). 

**Permitted Sources**  

Examples of allowed sources include:
* Apache 
* OIF 
* MIL-SPEC
