## Conventions
The key words shall (shall, SHALL, shall not, SHALL NOT), Should (should, SHOULD, should not, SHOULD NOT), and may (may, MAY) are to be interpreted as described. 

- Shall = requirement
Requirements are mandatory, must be done
Including the word “not” (as in shall not) specifies a mandatory prohibition, meaning the requirement explicitly forbids the action.

- Should = recommendation
Recommendations are optional yet indicate a preferred direction if implemented
Including the word “not” (as in should not) indicates a strong recommendation against performing an action

- May = allowable
Indicates flexibility of choice (option) with no implied preference.
